The dataset is based on customer demopraphics data, we are supposed to analyse the historical data of customer alongwith Product data and sales data and need to interpret various analysis by processing and optimizing ETL operations in Alteryx. The business data is generated and stored by company. When customer make purchase orders from company, customer profile gets generated and stored in company database. Each customer is assigned an unique customer id. Data being manipulated by Sales and Marketing team corresponding to each customer id. We have customer details and need to find out key objectives based upon business requirements. We are supposed to derive intuitive insights from Sales data to help management to take data-driven decisions.
